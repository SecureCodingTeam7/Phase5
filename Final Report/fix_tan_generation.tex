\section{Description}

Our app offers the possibility to use a SmartCardSimulator to generate transaction codes for single or batch transactions. This code can then be entered at our website or in the batch transaction batch file.
To verify the TAN, the webservice is using the same computations as the SCS. This includes the hashing of a string containing the current time as seed, the destination account, the amount and the pin of the user. This String was hashed with md5. This was a vulnerability because md5 is not secure in terms of collision attacks. So we changed the hashing algorithm to sha256 which generates a 256 bit long hash instead of 128 bit. The following transformations of the hashed string are required, because the c and java hash function are creating byte arrays. When converting this byte order to decimal numbers negative number can occur and will be converted to their absolute values. To get the same result in php the generated string, containing an hexadecimal number, has to be converted pairwisely and 127 has to substracted if the resulting number is greater tan 256.  \newline

	function generateTanWithSeed($seed,$pin,$destination,$amount){
	
	$plaintext = $seed.$pin.$destination.$amount.$seed;
	//$hash = $this->generateMD5Hash($plaintext);
	$hash = hash('sha256',$plaintext);
	$hash_array = array();
	for ($i=0;$i<16;$i += 2) {
	$tmp = substr($hash, $i,1).substr($hash, $i+1,1);
	array_push($hash_array, hexdec($tmp));
	}
	$hash_string = "";
	for ($j=0;$j<16;$j++) {
	$tmp = $hash_array[$j];
	if ($tmp > 127) {
	$tmp -= 256;
	}
	$hash_string .= strval(abs($tmp));
	}
	return substr($hash_string,0,15);
	}
\end{lstlisting}
The next problem was the  unavailbility of the time server which was used to synchronize the SCS and the webservice. Also it ensures that transaction codes for an transaction with the same amount and destinations differs over the time. This results in a stronger protecion against brutforcing the transaction codes. 
To fix this problem we simply changed the time server from that the time is requested, shown in Listing \ref{listing:time.}

\begin{lstlisting}[caption= New TimeServer IP, label=listing:time]
	function getUTCTime(){
	$timeserver = "129.6.15.28";
\end{lstlisting}
