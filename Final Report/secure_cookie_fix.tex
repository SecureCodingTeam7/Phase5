\chapter{Fix for Bypassing Session Management Schema and Cookies attributes}
\section{Affected Files}

\begin{itemize}
\item /etc/apache2/httpd.conf lines: 2++
\end{itemize}

\section{description}
In order to protect the session cookie and its attributes against attackers the following settings were added to httpd.conf:

\begin{lstlisting}
	    php_value session.cookie_httponly true
	    php_value session.cookie_secure true
	    php_value session.cookie_lifetime 1800
\end{lstlisting}

The httponly flag was already set in phase 3 and prevents that the session cookie can be acessed by javascript.
The http\_secure flag ensures that session cookies are only sent via HTTPS. \newline
Futhermore the attribute session cookie\_lifetime defines the expire data for a session cookie. A short lifetime decreases the chances for an attacker to sucessfully use a foreign session cookie to authenticate with the web service.
