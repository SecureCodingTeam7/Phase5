\chapter{Fix for Upload of Unexpected File Types}
Our app allows the user to upload any kind file for the batch transaction. But in our point of view that is nota vulnerability. Uploaded Files are not stored in the webroot of the server and are renamed before they are stored. Furthermore uplaod files are directly deleted after being parsed by the c program.
If an attacker woud have the possibility to to execute his code, the extension of the file would not make any difference.
To sum it up, allowing uploading any file extension increases the comfort of the user and has no influence on the security of our web service.
